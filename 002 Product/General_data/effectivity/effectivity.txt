12.1 General
The subject of the effectivity_schema is the validity of aspects of product data or product life cycle activity data specified against certain criteria.
This schema supports the representation of effectivity according to the following criteria:

- selection of a given batch of product data;
- selection of product data by serial number;
- selection of product data by a date.

This clause defines the information requirements to which implementations shall conform using the EXPRESS language as defined in ISO 10303-11. The following EXPRESS declaration begins the effectivity_schema and identifies the necessary external references.

Each implementation of an AP that uses this schema and that encodes entity names shall use the encoding specified in Annex A. Each reference to this schema in an open system shall use the identifier encoding specified in Annex B. This schema is illustrated in Annex D using the EXPRESS-G notation.

12.2 Fundamental concepts and assumptions
Effectivity information can be attached to any aspect of product data or product life cycle activity data.
Only effectivities based on date, serial number, and lot number are considered in this schema.
